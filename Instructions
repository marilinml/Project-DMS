Create an ASP.NET website in VB.NET or C# that comprises the following:
You should address each of the following points, but everything else is completely up to you and your interpretation – there are no wrong answers or interpretations. Please comment on your work and be prepared to discuss it with us.
 
1.	Create a Single Page Application web page for searching American Automobiles (GM, Ford, Chrysler). Making it look pretty isn’t necessary. Please use VUE.js and JQuery for constructing the client.
●	Sort by price, and model then price
2.	Create an API  in ASP.NET  to return json data. Schema is up to you. Create a handful of listings with:
●	Price
●	Model
●	MIleage
●	Color
●	Status
3.	Demonstrate the use of inheritance in the API by creating a class that represents a Car from the JSON output.
●	Create a base class
●	Create derived classes that have different business logic for two different clients: Dealer 1 and Dealer 2
○	For Dealer 1, if the Status is Active display  “For Sale”
○	For Dealer 2, if the Status is Active display “Active”.
4.	Be able to execute the web page from Step #1 above as either Dealer 1 or Dealer 2 dependent on a query string parameter.
